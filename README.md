# customjs-example ðŸ’»
Here you can copy from me and get an example of what custom js is ( Custom js example: bacon(); )
# Instructions
Choice 1:
You can change the variables to whatever you want and you can also
change the console.log message: edit inside this '' do not change 
any other code (look at "Choice 1: Part 2" if you want to change it), After that you can put in varname(); and the varname
will be the name of the variable that you made then after that run the file
and you will be able to make your own custom js (This is only an example)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Choice 1 : Part 2 
You can edit inside the { and }; and put in any custom js code you want
then it will run if you have the js code right.

Remove the +'s
